/**
 * Makes basic stun tests for cases where local network addresses and the public
 * NAT address are using different IP versions. (e.g. Local addresses are v4
 * public NAT address is v6 or vice versa)
 *
 *
 * The StunAddressDiscovererTest_XXX set of tests were created to verify stun
 * operation for scenarios of some basic types of firewalls. The purpose of
 * these tests is to make sure that transaction retransmissions and rereceptions
 * are handled transparently by the stack, as well as verify overall protocol
 * operations for IPv4/IPv6 and mixed environments.
