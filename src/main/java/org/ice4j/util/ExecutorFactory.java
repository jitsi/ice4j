        // The desired behaviour from pool is that it creates limited number
        // of threads based on current load, as well as releasing threads when
        // there is no work to execute.
        // Based on these requirements the following default configuration is
        // chosen.
        // <tt>corePoolSize</tt> for {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} is
        // behaved both as <tt>corePoolSize</tt> and <tt>maxPoolSize</tt>, so
        // it is actually fixed-size pool.
        // Even so spec says that corePoolSize is number of
        // threads to keep in pool they are actually created on demand, so if
        // there is no load, then threads are not created. But until pool has
        // less than <tt>corePoolSize</tt> threads, pool will create new thread,
        // to execute scheduled task, even though already created threads are
        // idle and have no tasks to execute.
        // <tt>keepAliveTime</tt> is configurable and specifies timeout before
        // idle core thread deleted from pool
        // <tt>removeOnCancelPolicy</tt> is set to true, to immediately remove
        // queued task from pool queue, because some task might be scheduled
        // with very big delay causing having reference to creator from pool
        //
        // Having <tt>corePoolSize</tt> is set to 0 with unlimited pool size
        // <tt>maximumPoolSize</tt> is observed to create only 1 thread in pool
        // no matter how many task are queued and become eligible to execute.
